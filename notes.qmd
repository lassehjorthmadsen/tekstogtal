## Notes and learnings for building Quarto websites

-   <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/>
-   I followed the 'Terminal' workflow. Seemed best.
-   I publish to GitHub Pages using terminal. Seems good. (Need to create custom url, though)
-   Workflow, once set up:
    -   In terminal do: `quarto preview` to preview
    -   In terminal do: `quarto render` to render everything
    -   In terminal do: `quarto publish` to publish to Github Pages
-
